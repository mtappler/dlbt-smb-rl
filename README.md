This repository contains code implementing an approach for differential learning-based testing of deep RL agents playing Super Mario Bros. 

The deep RL code is based on the [PyTorch tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/mario_rl_tutorial.html) on training deep RL agent for Super Mario Bros. and we use the [gym-super-bros environment](https://pypi.org/project/gym-super-mario-bros/).

The approach is described in the paper "Differential Safety Testing of Deep RL Agents Enabled by Automata Learning". More information is going to be added soon.
